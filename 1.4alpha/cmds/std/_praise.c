// History:
// 93-02-11     Written by Pallando based on Sulam's _bug.c
//              This file is part of the TMI Mudlib distribution.
//              Please include this header if you use this code.
// 93-07-13     Grendel added timestamping to make possible rlog.
// 93-07-20     Grendel added domain logging.
// 93-09-02     Checking for domain directory added.
//              NB Domains with directories different from their euids
//              will not have report logs.
